and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.0] - 2021-06-29

### Changed

 - Switch to Gridap 0.16. Note that we specifically need the fixes introduced in Gridap v0.16.3.

## [0.6.1] - 2021-06-24

### Added
- Method `AnalyticalGeometry(::Function)` to simplify the setup of geometries from user-defined functions.
- `export AnalyticalGeometry` in `GridapEmbedded`.

## [0.6.0] - 2021-01-12

### Changed

 - Switch to Gridap 0.15.
 - Switch from TravisCI to GitHubCI

## [0.5.0] - 2020-10-21

### Added

 - `AggregateCutCellsByThreshold` strategy as a general case of `AggregateAllCutCells`. Basic usage:

   ```
     strategy = AggregateAllCutCells() # Same as before
     strategy = AggregateCutCellsByThreshold(0.5) # New
   ```

### Changed

 - Signature of methods that implement aggregation strategies

## [0.4.0] - 2020-09-19

### Added

 - Support for Gridap v0.14.
 - Optional kw-argument `edges` to `square` function.

## [0.3.1] - 2020-07-25

### Added

 - Support for Gridap v0.12 and v0.13.
 - `square` function.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-06-23

### Changed

 - Updated code according to Gridap v0.11.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-05-21

### Added

 - Extended the `Cutter` interface with function `cut_facets` that allows one to
 cut the facets of the background model instead of the cells.
 - Support for AgFEM methods. This includes the generation of cell aggregates
 (via the `aggregate` function) and the construction of aggregated FE spaces
 (via the constructor `AgFEMSpace`).

### Changed

 - Minor change in type signature of `Subtriangulation`.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-04-21

### Added

- CSG machinery
- The `Cutter` interface representing a method that "cuts" the
  cells of a background `DiscreteModel` in order to generate different types of
  `Triangulations` that allow one to integrate on cut cells and embedded boundaries.
- Concrete implementation `LevelSetCutter <: Cutter` that allows one to cut a background model
  with either an analytical levelset function, i.e. a `AnalyticalGeometry` object, or a discrete
  levelset, i.e., a `DiscreteGeometry` object.
